Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews

Project Description:
Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews

Cleaned and preprocessed text data including stopword removal and stemming.

Converted text to numeric features using Bag of Words.

Built and evaluated Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers for sentiment prediction.

Achieved strong classification accuracy on unseen test data.

This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of 1,000 restaurant reviews, classifying each review as positive or negative. The process includes:

Data cleaning: removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords (except "not"), and stemming words to their root forms.

Feature extraction: using Bag of Words model with CountVectorizer to convert text into numeric features.

Model training: implementing Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers to predict review sentiment.

Evaluation: assessing model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

The project demonstrates foundational NLP techniques and classical machine learning applied to real-world text data
